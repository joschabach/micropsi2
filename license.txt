 I don't believe in duplicating effort, here are the projects I'm stealing from

NBT
We use a slightly modified version of Thomas Woolford's NBT parser in spock/mcp/nbt.py, original can be found here: https://github.com/twoolie/NBT

BarneyMC
We use slightly modified versions of large parts of Barney Gale's implementation of the MC Protocol, which can be found here: https://github.com/barneygale/barneymc

Large parts of spock/mcp/mcpacket.py, spock/mcp/mcdata.py, and spock/mcp/mcpacket_extensions.py are verbatim copies of his work simply updated to work with the current protocol

pyCraft
Large parts of Spock's design were inspired by Ammar Askar's pyCraft, which can be found here: https://github.com/ammaraskar/pyCraft

We use his implementation of the Minecraft.net login, found in spock/utils.py
